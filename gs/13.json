  "description": "State management libraries like Redux, Mobx, Vuex and similar are magical (you can tell by the x in the name). This talks demystifies them by looking at the problem they are solving, and solving it. Unidirectional data flow has been all the rage these past years - mostly thanks to libraries like React that use it heavily. But it is a bit of a counterintuitive pattern of work, so this presentation aims to demystify why and when itâ€™s actually needed and to explain all the strange words (dispatcher, reduced, store) that are used within it, by making a simple implementation in Angular using TypeScript from scratch.",
